The codes for generating the MAOC and PCX-MAOC, as well as analysing the contribution of molecular orbitals in the first N principal 
components with the restrictions mentioned in the article, are all available here and can be used directly from this repository, or 
by installing MAOC mol rep from pypi (pip install MAOC-mol-rep==0.0.2).
