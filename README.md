This repository offers some insight into the code behind the Matrix of Orthogonalized Atomic Orbital Coeffients, a novel molecular representation that can be used to distinguish compounds with various charge and spin multiplicities. 
Furthermore, the article this github supports introduces two new chemical datasets, N-HPC-1, REDOX, and a variation of the QM7b dataset known as QM7b(X), which are also explained in this repository.

## MAOC: A charge-variant molecular representation
The Matrix of Orthogonalized Atomic Orbital Coefficients (MAOC) is a charge-variant, symmetry-invariant molecular and atomic representation that can be used for quantum machine learning in predicting the QM properties (not limited to them) of molecular systems regardless of the ML model or system size. 
Users who are interested in generating MAOC can do so by installing the pypi package that supports the article that proposes MAOC:

`pip install MAOC-mol-rep==0.0.2`

A more recent version and structured code is available here:

`pip install maoc-support-functions`

The GitHub tutorial demonstrates how to use this package to build the MAOC representation.

Before installing MAOC, one should be aware of the dependencies that this package relies on:

### MAOC: A representation of all molecular systems

MAOC's universal application is one of its most distinguishing features.
This means that MAOC can be used to represent any type of molecule, from monatoms to single molecules and molecules with periodic boundary conditions (PBC).

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/hits-ccc/MAOC/blob/main/Images/git_1.png" width="700" height="300">
</p>

The code provided with the article allows users to generate the MAOC representation for molecules with atoms ranging from Z=1 to Z=55.
This is done for the simple reason that the basis set we're using is only compatible with these elements.
We demonstrated in the article that it is possible to produce MAOC for every single atom in the periodic table, so please contact us if your molecule contains atoms that are not on the list. 

### MAOC: A charge-dependent molecular representation

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/hits-ccc/MAOC/blob/main/Images/git_2.gif" width="400" height="300">
The matrix of orthogonalized atomic coefficients generated directly for the PySCF package is a charge invariant molecular representation.
Our group's recent focus has been on the properties of open-shell compounds (PAH and redox-active), so we needed a charge dependent compound capable of distinguishing compounds based on their nuclear coordinates, nuclear type, and charge/spin multiplicity. We used a simple trick to accomplish this: we changed the electronic structure of the atom with the highest atomic number from Z to Z-C, where C is the charge of the molecular system. Since the chosen basis set does not support the electronic structure of the new element, the charge of the compound for molecules with Z=53â€“55 is constrained to the range of (-2 (Z=53) to 0 (Z=55)). If your molecule has these types of atoms, please get in touch with us. 

The GIF depicts the charge-dependence of the MAOC representation of a methane molecule with various charges/spin multiplicities.
The cosine similarity of the specific matrix to the charge zero matrix is indicated in the GIF.

## Datasets
This section provides brief information about the datasets proposed in the article that this github supports.

<summary>N-HPC-1 dataset </summary>
  
### The dataset of N-heteropolycyclic compounds 
 <p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/hits-ccc/MAOC/blob/main/Images/git_4.png" width="550" height="300">
  </p>
  
The N-HPC-1 dataset was inspired by the fascinating magnetic, electric, and optical properties of the N-doped PAH.
Because one of the characteristics of N-heteropolycycles is their open-shell stability, we decided to investigate some small open and closed-shell N-HPC in a combinatorial approach. The algorithm we developed to generate N-doped PAH is available [HERE](https://github.com/hits-ccc/MAOC/tree/main/Codes/Generative_Algorithm_for_N-Doped_Novel_Aromatics). To generate respective open-shell compounds, one, two, or three
electrons were removed, or one electron was added to the neutral molecules to produce eight groups
within the dataset: neutral singlets, neutral triplets, anionic doublets, cationic doublets, dicationic
singlets, dicationic triplets, tricationic doublets, and tricationic quartets. All of the compounds in the dataset have their geometry optimised using PBE0-D3/def2-TZVP and ORCA 5.0 package. 
This dataset is available [HERE](https://github.com/hits-ccc/MAOC/tree/main/Datasets/NHPC1).

<summary>REDOX dataset </summary>
  
### A collection of a some popular redox-active compounds. 
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/hits-ccc/MAOC/blob/main/Images/git_3.png" width="550" height="300">
  
There are 4,146 neutral , 4018 anionic and 687 cationic open- and closed-shell redox-active molecules with 1-4 unpaired electrons in this dataset.
Organic radicals (nitroxyl, phenoxyl, and galvinoxyl), carbonyl compounds (quinones, carboxylates, and phenazine-derived radicals), and cyanides are among the compounds represented in the dataset. All of the compounds in the dataset have their geometry optimised using PBE0-D3/def2-TZVP and ORCA 5.0 package. This dataset is available [HERE](https://github.com/hits-ccc/MAOC/tree/main/Datasets/REDOX).

<summary>QM7b<sup> X </sup> dataset </summary>

### A dataset of open and closed-shell compounds based on the QM7b compounds

</p>

To evaluate the performance of MAOC for radicals and ions, the geometries of the anionic, cationic, and dicationic forms of the compounds in the QM7b dataset were optimised, and their various vertical and adiabatic properties were computed and strongly spin-contaminated species were removed from the dataset.
As a result, 7,197 geometry-optimized anion radicals, 6,999 geometry-optimized cation radicals, 7,198 geometry-optimized dications, and 7,208 anion radicals and 7,208 cation radicals in the geometry of the parent neutral molecule were added to the original QM7b dataset of neutral molecules.
This expanded dataset is known as QM7b<sup> X </sup>. The anionic, cationic, and dicationic compounds' geometries were optimised using PBE0-D3/def2-TZVP, and the SPE for vertical anions and cations were computed using the same combination of level of theory/basis set.
